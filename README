fossup is a Fossology uploading program for file/archives.

Installation
------------
Pretty straightforward here:

sudo python3 setup.py install


General Use
------------
It is highly suggested that the username/password and url for your fossology instance 
is kept with your rc file (see Settings File Format)

fossup.py -n "My Test Directory" -f archive.tgz -d "Test Archive" -c ~/.fossuprc

Settings File
-------------
If not specified with -c flag, we will look for ~/.fossuprc first, then default to 
/etc/fossuprc (which was installed during setup

The config file should be relatively obvious if you're familiar with Fossology
